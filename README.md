# Verve Theme

Welcome to Verve — a bold, flexible, and easy-to-use WordPress block theme crafted by [Two Palms Creative](https://twopalmscreative.co). Verve blends high-end editorial flair with strategic design and personality-packed structure. It’s built with The Drift Method™, my signature full-site flow designed to guide your visitors from "hey y’all" to "heck yes."

## What You Get
This theme is ready to use out of the box — no coding needed, no confusing setup steps. It's designed for business owners, creatives, and go-getters who want a stunning, scroll-stopping site that works as hard as they do.

Here's what Verve includes:

- **5 core pages** (Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact) built with The Drift Method™  
- **Custom page layouts** with full-site editing enabled  
- **Responsive, mobile-friendly design**  
- **Style settings** (colors, fonts, spacing) you can tweak to match your brand  
- **Optional patterns and blocks** (available as add-on purchases at a later date) designed to match Verve’s editorial, polished vibe  

## Who It’s For
Verve is made for business owners who want:  
- A luxe, high-impact design that builds trust fast  
- Strategy baked into every section  
- A website they can update and manage with ease  

Whether you’re a coach, service provider, creative, or small team looking to make a bold digital impression, Verve gives you the structure and styling to do just that.

## Getting Started
1. Install the theme on your WordPress site under **Appearance > Themes**.  
2. Activate Verve.  
3. Customize your site using the WordPress Site Editor. You can change fonts, colors, layouts, and more.  
4. Swap in your content, adjust blocks as needed, and launch with confidence.  

Verve includes built-in demo content within the blocks themselves, so you’ll see example layouts and placeholder copy as soon as you activate the theme. If you’d like to experiment with demo blog posts, we recommend using a plugin like FakerPress to populate sample content.

## What Makes Verve Different
- **Built with The Drift Method™**: a full-site structure that blends storytelling with strategy  
- **Conversion-forward design**: every section flows with intention and guides visitors toward action  
- **Styled for a bold brand personality**: editorial layouts, strong type, clean lines, and a confident voice  
- **No bloat, no builder plugins**: just clean code and core WordPress blocks  

## Tech Notes (for the curious)
This theme was originally based on WDS-BT by twopalmscreative, and I’ve tailored it for non-technical users who still want a high-performing site. All the developer tooling (like build scripts, npm, composer, etc.) has been removed from this version, so you don’t need to worry about anything behind the scenes.

If you’re a developer and want the full build system for advanced customizations, feel free to reach out — I’m happy to provide access to the developer version.

## License
Verve is licensed under the GPL v3. That means you can customize it as much as you want. Just don’t sell it as-is or claim it as your own original work.

## Made with Love by Two Palms Creative
I believe your website should reflect your personality **and** your purpose. Verve is part of my full theme collection — each one rooted in clarity, designed to convert, and styled to feel like *you*.
